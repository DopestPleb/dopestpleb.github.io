            <h1 class="about-header">About Me</h1>
            <p class="about-para">How's it going?  My name's Jonah aka DopestPleb and I'm a 15 year old computer enthusiast.  I enjoy biking, programming, gaming, and streaming.</p>

            <h2 class="about-subheader">Programming</h2>
            <p class="about-para">I've been programming since September 2010.  I first learned drag and drop programming in 1st grade.  In 3rd grade, I
            started programming in a Javascript library called processing.js on Khan Academy. I worked in this language for about 4  I checked out their other courses and apparently the web development courses were  years before
            I realized how out of date the site's courses were.  I checked out their other courses and apparently the web development courses were
            up to date.  I worked more on the website for 2 more years.  Now I started to get hungry to learn more abotu programming.  So, I moved onto
            working on Discord bots in Discord.js, a Node.js module.  I learned a whole lot more through this with the help of many great people.
            After working with this for about 2 years, I was starting freshman year of highschool so I decided to check out my school's computer
            science courses.  I decided to take Python Programming and a Raspberry PI course.  This taught me a lot about how langauges translated.
            I started focusing on learning how to translate programming langauges to english to then it would be easier to write pseudo-code and
            learn other languages.  This was last year.  Since starting my sophomore year, I have learned C#, entered two different game jams,
            reached 1000 members in my programming discord server, started take Intro into Computer Science and Web Design at my school, released
            a website, and built my own computer.  I have learned so much in 9 years and yet there is so much more to learn.</p>

            <h2 class="about-subheader">Gaming</h2>
            <p class="about-para">I started gaming when I was 9 when my parents got my family a Nintendo Wii for Christmas.  I played Super Mario
            Bros for hours.  When I was 11 my dad introduced me to the Call of Duty games.  I started playing Modern Warefare 3 and soon surpassed
            my friends that have been playing Call of Duty for a few years.  On November 13th, 2017 I bought myself an Xbox One.  I started playing
            Call of Duty WWII as well as Battlefield 1.  I soon got bored of these games after about a week or two.  So one day I was scrolling through
            free games on the Xbox store and saw a game called Fortnite.  I had no clue what is was but I gave it a try.  I got hooked and then saw
            the game blow shortly afterwards.  I played this game for a year and a half.  I then built a PC after years of saving and started playing
            Counter Strike: Global Offensive as well as Rust.  I now play a variety of games and stream them all.</p>
